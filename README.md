This Repository contains the projects created for the programming course **Operating Systems** (6th Semester at the Computer Systems track) at the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens.

**Exercise Statements are in PDF format in the directory of each exercise (in greek)**

During that course, I learned :

  * The basics of **threads** and **processes**

  * **Concurrency** of threads and processes

  * Semaphores, locks and various other similar mechanisms
  
  * Process synchronization and communication 

  * CPU Scheduling

  * Memory Management

  * File Management
